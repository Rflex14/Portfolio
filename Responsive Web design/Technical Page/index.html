        <p>PHP (recursive acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into HTML.</p>
        <p>Meaning:</p>
        <pre class="wrapper"><code><div>&lt!DOCTYPE html> 
  &lthtml>
    &lthead>
        &lttitle>Example</title>
    &lt/head>
    &ltbody>
        &lt?php
          echo "Hi, I'm a PHP script!";
        ?>
    &lt/body>
  &lt/html></div></code></pre>
       <p>The PHP code is enclosed in special start and end processing instructions <?php and ?> that allow jumping in and out of PHP mode.</p>
       <p>What distinguishes PHP from something like client-side JavaScript is that the code is executed on the server, generating HTML which is then sent to the client. The client would receive the results of running that script, but would not know what the underlying code was. A web server can even be configured to process all HTML files with PHP, and then there's no way that users can tell that PHP is being used.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="What_Can_It_Do?" class="main-section">
        <header>What Can It Do?</header>
        <p>Anything. PHP is mainly focused on server-side scripting, so it can do anything any other CGI program can do, such as collect form data, generate dynamic page content, or send and receive cookies. But PHP can do much more.</p>
        <p>There are two main areas where PHP scripts are used:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Server-side scripting. This is the most widely used and main target field for PHP. Three things are needed to make this work: the PHP parser (CGI or server module), a web server, and a web browser. All these can run on a local machine in order to just experiment with PHP programming. See the installation instructions section for more information.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Command line scripting. A PHP script can be run without any server or browser, only the PHP parser is needed to use it this way. This type of usage is ideal for scripts regularly executed using cron (on Unix or macOS) or Task Scheduler (on Windows). These scripts can also be used for simple text processing tasks. See the section about Command line usage of PHP for more information.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So with PHP, developers have the freedom of choosing an operating system and a web server. Furthermore, they also have the choice of using procedural programming or object-oriented programming (OOP), or a mixture of them both.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="Basic_Syntax" class="main-section">
        <header>Basic Syntax</header>
        <p>When PHP parses a file, it looks for opening and closing tags, which are <?php and ?> which tell PHP to start and stop interpreting the code between them. Parsing in this manner allows PHP to be embedded in all sorts of different documents, as everything outside of a pair of opening and closing tags is ignored by the PHP parser.</p>
        <p>PHP includes a short echo tag <?= which is a short-hand to the more verbose <?php echo.</p>
        <p>For Example:</p>
        <pre class="wrapper"><code><ul><li>&lt?php echo 'if you want to serve PHP code in XHTML or XML documents, use these tags';?></li><br><li>You can use the short echo tag to &lt?= 'print this string'?>.<br>
It's equivalent to &lt?php echo 'print this string'?>.</li><br><li>&lt? echo 'this code is within short tags, but will only work '.'if short_open_tag is enabled';?></li></ul></code></pre>
        <p>If a file contains only PHP code, it is preferable to omit the PHP closing tag at the end of the file. This prevents accidental whitespace or new lines being added after the PHP closing tag, which may cause unwanted effects because PHP will start output buffering when there is no intention from the programmer to send any output at that point in the script.</p>
        <p>Like:</p>
        <pre class="wrapper"><code><div>&lt?php

  echo "Hello world";

  // ... more code

  echo "Last statement";

  // the script ends here with no PHP closing tag</div></code></pre>
      </section>
      <section id="Escaping_Html" class="main-section">
        <header>Escaping Html</header>
        <p>Everything outside of a pair of opening and closing tags is ignored by the PHP parser which allows PHP files to have mixed content. This allows PHP to be embedded in HTML documents, for example to create templates.</p>
        <pre class="wrapper"><code><div>&ltp>This is going to be ignored by PHP and displayed by the browser.&lt/p>
&lt?php echo 'While this is going to be parsed.';?>
&ltp>This will also be ignored by PHP and displayed by the browser.&lt/p></div></code></pre>
        <p>This works as expected, because when the PHP interpreter hits the ?> closing tags, it simply starts outputting whatever it finds (except for the immediately following newline) until it hits another opening tag unless in the middle of a conditional statement in which case the interpreter will determine the outcome of the conditional before making a decision of what to skip over.</p><p>See the next example,
Using structures with conditions.</p>
        <pre class="wrapper"><code>&lt?php if ($expression == true): ?>
  This will show if the expression is true.
&lt?php else: ?>
  Otherwise this will show.
&lt?php endif; ?></code></pre>
        <p>In this example PHP will skip the blocks where the condition is not met, even though they are outside of the PHP open/close tags; PHP skips them according to the condition since the PHP interpreter will jump over blocks contained within a condition that is not met.</p>
        <p>For outputting large blocks of text, dropping out of PHP parsing mode is generally more efficient than sending all of the text through echo or print.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="Comments" class="main-section">
        <header>Comments</header>
        <p>PHP supports 'C', 'C++' and Unix shell-style (Perl style) comments. For example:</p>
        <pre class="wrapper"><code><div>&lt?php
    echo 'This is a test'; // This is a one-line c++ style comment
    /* This is a multi line comment
       yet another line of comment */
    echo 'This is yet another test';
    echo 'One Final Test'; # This is a one-line shell-style comment
?></div></code></pre>
        <p>The "one-line" comment styles only comment to the end of the line or the current block of PHP code, whichever comes first. This means that HTML code after // ... ?> or # ... ?> WILL be printed: ?> breaks out of PHP mode and returns to HTML mode, and // or # cannot influence that.</p>
        <pre class="wrapper"><code><div>&lth1>This is an <?php # echo 'simple';?> example</h1>
&ltp>The header above will say 'This is an  example'.&lt/p></div></code></pre>
        <p>'C' style comments end at the first */ encountered. Make sure you don't nest 'C' style comments. It is easy to make this mistake if you are trying to comment out a large block of code.</p>
        <pre class="wrapper"><code><div>&lt?php
 /*
    echo 'This is a test'; /* This comment will cause a problem */
 */
?></div></code></pre>
