          <ul id="characteristics">
            <li><span class="bold">Dark Souls</span> is considerable more difficult than other Action JRPGS of it's time, trusting in the players ability to adapt and overcome challenges.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Dark Souls</span> has an unconventional narration method, using it's level design and item descriptions as a way to communicate with the player about the world the game takes place in.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Dark Souls</span> has different movesets for each distinct weapon class usable in the game.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Dark Souls</span> implements a currency called Souls not only to buy items, but to level up the player character.</li>
            <li>This Soul currency is dropped on death and can be recovered in the same place the player died unless the player dies again before recollecting them.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Dark Souls</span> checkpoints are represented by bonfires spread around the world, in which the player can rest, allowing it to level up, turn human, recover it's health, spell casts, healing charges and respawning enemies.</li>

          <p id="meaning"><span class="indent"></span>For some, it's a hard game they proudly have beaten; For others, It's their preferred dark fantasy game where they can become stronger and end up slaying the most abominable beast imaginable, and finally, some people consider it a familiar place as a result of replaying it after beating it the first time, the game's atmosphere is like a warm embrace, welcoming you back to a rich world full of legendary stories, characters and adversaries. Pushing you towards challenging yourself, but allowing you multiple moments of respite.</p><p><span class="indent"></span>In a way, this incredibly difficult and sometimes stressful game became a safe haven for people to take a break from their real life problems, breath, <span class="bold">and then go back out and triumph.</span></p>
